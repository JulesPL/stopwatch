# Stopwatch
This is a vanilla-JavaScript implementation of the iOS 9 Stopwatch. I wrote it a couple years back to see how an actual MVC architecture could manifest in JavaScript.

## Usage
```npm start``` will start a static-server and open the Stopwatch in your default browser.

## Features
- [x] Start the stopwatch
- [x] Stop the stopwatch
- [x] Reset the stopwatch
- [x] Record a Lap
